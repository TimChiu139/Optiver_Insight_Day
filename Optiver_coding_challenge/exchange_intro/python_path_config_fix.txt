The Cloud9 IDE reads Python sources in all locations specified by the so-called Python Path, which it can then use to
auto-complete code and provide relevant documentation where needed. This is specified in the Project Configuration under
Python Support, but the default value is set for the wrong Python version. For the optimal experience it should be
changed to the following string:

/usr/lib64/python3.6:/usr/lib64/python3.6/lib-dynload:/usr/local/lib64/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages:/usr/lib64/python3.6/dist-packages:/usr/lib/python3.6/dist-packages
